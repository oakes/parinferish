# Paren Mode

## Indentation Threshold Clamping

clamp left

```in
(let [foo 1]
foo)
```

```out
(let [foo 1]
 foo)
```

clamp right

```in
(let [foo 1]
      foo)
```

```out
(let [foo 1]
     foo)
```

```in
(let [foo {:a 1}]
           foo)
```

```out
(let [foo {:a 1}]
     foo)
```

sanity check to apply rules to multiple expressions

```in
(let [foo 1]
      foo)

(let [foo 1]
foo)
```

```out
(let [foo 1]
     foo)

(let [foo 1]
 foo)
```

## Relative Indentation

keep relative indentation of child expressions:

```in
(let [foo [1 2 3]]
      (-> foo
          (map inc)))
```

```out
(let [foo [1 2 3]]
     (-> foo
         (map inc)))
```

## Leading Close-Paren


Close-parens at start of line are moved to end of previous line.  Note that the
spaces before the close-paren are not removed.

```in
(let [foo 1
      ]; <-- spaces
  foo)
```

```out
(let [foo 1]
      ; <-- spaces
  foo)
```

```in
(let [foo 1
      bar 2

     ] (+ foo bar
  ); <-- spaces
)
```

```out
(let [foo 1
      bar 2]

     (+ foo bar))
  ; <-- spaces

```

## Inside the Indentation Treshold

extra indent is fine (won't cause parinfer to restructure it)

```in
(def x [1 2 3 4
         5 6 7 8])
```

```out
(def x [1 2 3 4
         5 6 7 8])
```

doesn't try to align siblings.

```in
  (assoc x
:foo 1
     :bar 2)
```

```out
  (assoc x
   :foo 1
     :bar 2)
```

## Unclosed Parens

```in
(foo
```

```out
(foo
^ error: unclosed-paren
```

```in
(defn foo
[arg arg2
bar
```

```out
(defn foo
[arg arg2
^ error: unclosed-paren
bar
```

## Unmatched close-parens

```in
(foo})
```

```out
(foo})
    ^ error: unmatched-close-paren
```

```in
(foo
  })
```

```out
(foo
  })
  ^ error: unmatched-close-paren
```

```in
(defn foo
  [arg
  bar)
```

```out
(defn foo
  [arg
  bar)
     ^ error: unmatched-close-paren
```

## Backslash cases

escape character in comment untouched:

```in
; hello \n world
```

```out
; hello \n world
```

escaped whitespace

```in
(def foo \,)
(def bar \ )
```

```out
(def foo \,)
(def bar \ )
```

Hanging backslash at end of line is invalid and causes processing to be abandoned.

```in
(foo [a b]\
c)
```

```out
(foo [a b]\
          ^ error: eol-backslash
c)
```

## Unclosed Quotes

```in
(def foo
  "hello
  bar)
```

```out
(def foo
  "hello
  ^ error: unclosed-quote
  bar)
```

## Dangerous Quotes

odd number of quotes not allowed in a comment, so it remains unprocessed:

```in
(def foo [a b]
  ; "my string
ret)
```

```out
(def foo [a b]
  ; "my string
    ^ error: quote-danger
ret)
```

balanced quotes allowed across contiguous comments:

```in
(def foo [a b]
  ; "my multiline
  ; docstring."
ret)
```

```out
(def foo [a b]
  ; "my multiline
  ; docstring."
 ret)
```

## Multiline Strings

A line ending inside a string will not have a definable Paren Trail.  This
minimal test case will fail if the close-paren is treated as a Paren Trail.

```in
( )"
"
```

```out
( )"
"
```

## Spaces in Paren Trail

Preserve spaces in paren trail for the cursor line.  This allows the user
to insert things between close-parens more easily.

```in
(foo |)
```

```out
(foo |)
```

```in
(foo [1 2 3 |] )
```

```out
(foo [1 2 3 |] )
```

But get rid of spaces in paren trail if no cursor is present on the line:

```in
(foo )
```

```out
(foo)
```

```in
(foo [1 2 3 ] )
```

```out
(foo [1 2 3])
```

## Cursor Behavior

Pressing enter before a close-paren.

```in
(foo [a b
|])
```

```out
(foo [a b
      |])
```

Cursor pushed forward when a form is balanced and indented.

```in
(foo [1 2 3
 4 5 6
 7 8 9])|
```

```out
(foo [1 2 3
      4 5 6
      7 8 9])|
```

## Changes

When backspacing, preserve the indentation of the child lines.

```in
(let     [foo 1
     ----
           ; comment 1
           bar 2
           baz 3])
           ; comment 2
```

```out
(let [foo 1
       ; comment 1
       bar 2
       baz 3])
       ; comment 2
```

```in
   (def foo
---
      ; comment 1
      bar)
      ; comment 2
```

```out
(def foo
   ; comment 1
   bar)
   ; comment 2
```

When typing before an open-paren, preserve the indentation of the child lines.

```in
(def foo (bar
    ++++
       4 5 6
       ; comment 1
       7 8 9))
       ; comment 2
```

```out
(def foo (bar
           4 5 6
           ; comment 1
           7 8 9))
           ; comment 2
```

__Multiple changes__:

```in
(my-fnfoo (if some-condition
 -----+++
         println) my-funfoo {:foo 1
                  ------+++
                          :bar 2})
```

```out
(foo (if some-condition
       println) foo {:foo 1
                     :bar 2})
```

## Extending indentation constraints

Child lines should never fall to the right of a sibling list somewhere above it.
This promotes more structural stability in Indent Modeâ€”allowing child lines
to be deleted without affecting structure of subsequent lines.

In the example below, the original Paren Mode would dedent `1 2 3`, but would
leave `4 5 6` unchanged.  Subsequently, if the user deletes `1 2 3` in Indent
Mode, `4 5 6` would immediately be adopted into the `[bar baz]` collection,
which is likely an unintended side effect.

This places a harder constraint on indentation in Paren Mode than Indent Mode,
making the invariant no longer equivalent between them.

```in
(foo [bar baz]
       1 2 3
       4 5 6)
```

```out
(foo [bar baz]
     1 2 3
     4 5 6)
```

```in
(foo [bar baz
         ]; <-- spaces
       1 2 3
       4 5 6)
```

```out
(foo [bar baz]
         ; <-- spaces
     1 2 3
     4 5 6)
```

## Paren Trails

We return non-empty Paren Trails so plugins can dim them with markers:


```in
(defn foo
  "hello, this is a docstring"
  [a b]
  (let [sum (+ a b)
        prod (* a b)]
     {:sum sum
      :prod prod}))
```

```out
(defn foo
  "hello, this is a docstring"
  [a b]
      ^ parenTrail
  (let [sum (+ a b)
                  ^ parenTrail
        prod (* a b)]
                   ^^ parenTrail
     {:sum sum
      :prod prod}))
                ^^^ parenTrail
```

## Indenting Selected Lines

Indent only the first line:

```in
  (foo
++
  (bar
    baz))
```

```out
  (foo
    (bar
      baz))
```

Indent first two lines:

```in
  (foo
++
    (bar
++
    baz))
```

```out
  (foo
    (bar
      baz))
```

Indent last two lines:

```in
  (foo
      (bar
++
        baz))
++
```

```out
  (foo
      (bar
        baz))
```


Indent only the first line:

```in
  (foo
++
  bar
  baz)
```

```out
  (foo
    bar
    baz)
```

Indent first two lines:

```in
  (foo
++
    bar
++
  baz)
```

```out
  (foo
    bar
    baz)
```

Indent last two lines:

```in
(foo
    bar
++
    baz)
++
```

```out
(foo
    bar
    baz)
```

## Tab Stops

> __NOTE__: should be copied from same section in Indent Mode

We can return the positions of the open-parens whose structure would be
affected by the indentation of the current cursor line.  This allows editors to
use them to create tab stops for smart indentation snapping.

```in
(def x [1 2 3])
(def y 2)
|
```

```out
(def x [1 2 3])
(def y 2)
^    > tabStops
|
```

The `>` means the position of the first arg after an open-paren, because some styles
use it for alignment.

```in
(foo bar
  (baz boo))
|
```

```out
(foo bar
  (baz boo))
^ ^    > tabStops
|
```

```in
(let [a {:foo 1}
      |
      bar [1 2 3]]
  bar)
```

```out
(let [a {:foo 1}
^    ^  ^     > tabStops
      |
      bar [1 2 3]]
  bar)
```

```in
(let [a {:foo 1}
      bar (func 1 2 3)]
  |
  bar)
```

```out
(let [a {:foo 1}
      bar (func 1 2 3)]
^    ^    ^     > tabStops
  |
  bar)
```
